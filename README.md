# Cartography
A collection of GIS maps created for university coursework, demonstrating proficiency in spatial analysis and cartographic design. Includes examples of hydrology, terrain, and least-cost-path modeling:

![lcp trails](https://github.com/avaerickson/Cartography/blob/main/Maps/lcp_trails.jpg?raw=true)
Least-cost-path analysis using landcover friction raster and digital elevation model to map best routes for accessing pre-defined timber locations from a sawmill.


![hydro stream order](https://github.com/avaerickson/Cartography/blob/main/Maps/hydro_stream_order.jpg?raw=true)
Hydrology analysis using a conditional statement to isolate areas of high flow accumulation (DEM derrived) and visualizing stream order based on Strahler ordering system.


![hydro lcp](https://github.com/avaerickson/Cartography/blob/main/Maps/hydro_lcp.jpg?raw=true)
Combining least-cost-path and hydrology methods to use DEM derrived flow accumulation and flow direction rasters as inputs for least-cost-path computation to track the likely flow of a pollutant from a defined source.

![basin model](https://github.com/avaerickson/Cartography/blob/main/Maps/river_basin_model.png?raw=true)
![hydro regions](https://github.com/avaerickson/Cartography/blob/main/Maps/hydro_regions.jpg?raw=true)
Hydrology analysis defining connected regions of high flow accumulation and high wetness index, which reveals isolated areas where pollutants may spread quickly and easily. 


![terrain resolution](https://github.com/avaerickson/Cartography/blob/main/Maps/terrain_resolution.jpg?raw=true)
![hydro dem](https://github.com/avaerickson/Cartography/blob/main/Maps/hydro_dem.jpg?raw=true)
![terrain aspect](https://github.com/avaerickson/Cartography/blob/main/Maps/terrain_aspect.jpg?raw=true)
![accumulated cost](https://github.com/avaerickson/Cartography/blob/main/Maps/lcp_accumulated_cost.jpg?raw=true)
Least-cost-path analysis using landcover friction raster (accumulated cost raster) to determine, cell-by-cell, the easiest path from Origin to Destination. Contour lines visualize accumulated cost and cluster at areas of extremely high cost.
