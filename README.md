# Cartography
A collection of GIS maps created for university coursework, demonstrating proficiency in spatial analysis and cartographic design. Includes examples of hydrology, terrain, and least-cost-path modeling:

![viewshed guad peak](https://github.com/avaerickson/Cartography/blob/main/Maps/viewshed_guad_peak.jpg?raw=true)
Viewshed analysis using DEM informed line-of-sight algorithm to identify all cells visible from Guadalupe Peak.

![lcp trails](https://github.com/avaerickson/Cartography/blob/main/Maps/lcp_trails.jpg?raw=true)
Least-cost-path analysis using landcover friction raster and digital elevation model (DEM) to map best routes for accessing pre-defined timber locations from a sawmill.


![hydro stream order](https://github.com/avaerickson/Cartography/blob/main/Maps/hydro_stream_order.jpg?raw=true)
Hydrology analysis using a conditional statement to isolate areas of high flow accumulation (DEM derrived) to predict stream locations. Visualizing stream order based on Strahler ordering system.


![hydro lcp](https://github.com/avaerickson/Cartography/blob/main/Maps/hydro_lcp.jpg?raw=true)
Combining least-cost-path and hydrology methods to use DEM derrived flow accumulation and flow direction rasters as inputs for least-cost-path computation to track the likely flow of a pollutant from a defined source.

![basin model](https://github.com/avaerickson/Cartography/blob/main/Maps/river_basin_model.png?raw=true)
Hydrology analysis using a conditional statement to isolate large water basins derrived from flow direction. 


![terrain resolution](https://github.com/avaerickson/Cartography/blob/main/Maps/terrain_resolution.jpg?raw=true)
Visualizing the impact of coarse vs. fine resolution on slope data, which can have terrain analysis implications. Resolution and slope relationship must be considered when selecting interpolaton methods during geoprocessing tasks. 


![terrain aspect](https://github.com/avaerickson/Cartography/blob/main/Maps/terrain_aspect.jpg?raw=true)
Terrain analysis using DEM to depict the direction each cell's slope is facing. 

![GCW Habitat](https://github.com/avaerickson/GCW_Habitat_Analysis/raw/main/images/gcw_amnt_dev.png?raw=true)
Habitat analysis performed with transition matrices to identify landcover change from 2001 to 2021.
